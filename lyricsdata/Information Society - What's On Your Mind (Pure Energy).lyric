I wanna know
What you're thinking
There are some things you can't hide
I wanna know
What you're feeling
Tell me what's on your mind

Pure energy
Pure energy

Here I am in silence,
Looking 'round without a clue
I find myself along again
All alone with you
I can see behind your eyes,
The things that I don't know.
If you hide away from me,
How can our love grow?

I wanna know
What you're thinking.
There are some things you can't hide.
