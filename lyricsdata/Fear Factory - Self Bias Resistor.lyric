Hey you, wake up
Open your swollen eyes
Erosion invades your mind
A cancer that grows over time

Hey you, rise up
Rise to fight, eliminate
Burn your fuse to detonate
The human machines of hate

All these years they've tried to break you
To your knees
Anger scours right through your veins
Now it's time to put an end
To all the lies
Now it's time to take control
Of your life

Woh

Wake up, rise up
Open minds will dominate
...
