Get your motor running
Head out on the highway
Lookin' for adventure
In whatever comes our way

Yeah, darlin', gonna make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once and
Explode into space

I like smoke and lightning
Heavy metal thunder
Racin' with the wind
And the feeling that I'm under
