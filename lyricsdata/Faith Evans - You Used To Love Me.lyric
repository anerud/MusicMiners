I remember the way, you used to love me
I remember the days, you used to love me

You don't appreciate the time
I put into this love affair of ours baby
I couldn't let you walk around
Thinking it's alright to let me down

(I remember)
I remember the way you used to love me
(Baby I remember the way)
I remember the days you used to love me
(oh you used to love me)

I gave you all my precious love
