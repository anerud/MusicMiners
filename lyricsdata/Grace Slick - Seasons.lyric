When the winter comes
The sun is low upon the fields
The sky is cold
And it throws down icy snow

The lakes are glass
The river's all a frozen mass
The trees are bare
And the north wind blows the air

But the children dance and sing
As if the time were spring
When the seasons change everything
They find a joy in what it brings

Then the sun comes high
And the spring rains come and go
The summer air is so hot
...
