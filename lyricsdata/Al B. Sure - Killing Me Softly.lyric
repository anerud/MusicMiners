I heard she sang a good song
I heard she had a style
And so I came to see her
To listen for a while

And there she was
This young girl
A stranger to my eyes

[CHORUS:]
Strumming my pain
With her fingers
She was singing
My life with her words
Killing me softly
With her song
Killing me softly
With her song
Telling my whole life
With her words
Killing me softly
With her song
