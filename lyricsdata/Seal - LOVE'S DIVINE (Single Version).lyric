There the rainstorm came over me
And I felt my spirit break
I had lost all of my belief you see
And realized my mistake
But time threw a prayer to me
And all around me became still
I need love, love's divine
Please forgive me now
I see that I've been blind
Give me love, love is what I need
To help me know my name
I need love, love's divine
Please forgive me now
I see that I've been blind
Give me love, love is what I need
