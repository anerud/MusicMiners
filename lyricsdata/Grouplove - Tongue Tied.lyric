Take me to your best friend's house
Go around this roundabout
Oh yeah
Take me to your best friend's house
I loved you then and I love you now
Oh yeah

Don't take me tongue tied
Don't wave no goodbye
Don't...

Take me to your best friend's house
Normally we're making out
Oh yeah
Take me to your best friend's house
I loved you then and I love you now

Don't take me tongue tied
...
