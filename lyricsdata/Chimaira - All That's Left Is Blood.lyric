Take a look to the sky emptiness surrounds us
Feel so meaninglessness
Murder, anarchy a state of distress
So cynical and halfhearted
Becoming the shameless no association
The signal disconnects who cares what has been said
The tide turned to red
All that is left is blood
All that is left is blood

Feel the cold steel on the back of your head
One click and it is over
