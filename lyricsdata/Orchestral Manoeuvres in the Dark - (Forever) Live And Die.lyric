I never wanted another
Come over to me and discover
I want to be near you
And you need to be far away
You always seem to make
me feel at home
Hey
People I know
I never know, I never
know, I never know, I
never know why
You make me want to cry
I never know, I never
know, I never know, I
never know why
Forever live and die
