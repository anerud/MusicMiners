I try to discover
A little something to make me sweeter
Oh baby refrain from breaking my heart

I'm so in love with you
I'll be forever blue
That you give me no reason
Why you're making me work so hard?

That you give me no
That you give me no
That you give me no
That you give me no

Soul
I hear you calling
Oh baby please
Give a little respect to me
