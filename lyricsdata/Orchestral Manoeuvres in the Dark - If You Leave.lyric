If you leave, don't leave now
Please don't take my heart away
Promise me, just one more night
Then we'll go our separate ways
We've always had time on our side
Now it's fading fast
Every second, every moment
We've gotta make it last

I touch you once, I touch you twice
I won't let go at any price
I need you now like I need you then
You always said we'd still be friends someday
