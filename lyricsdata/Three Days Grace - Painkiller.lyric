You know you need a fix when you fall down
You know you need to find a way
To get you through another day
Let me be the one to numb you out
Let me be the one to hold you
Never gonna let you get away

The shoulder you cry on
The dust that you die on

I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer
Love me till it's all over, over
'Cause I'm the shoulder you cry on
The dust that you die on
...
