As I watch you close the door
With nothing to say
I remember us before
Love slipped away

Won't you tell me
What did I do? What did I say?
How about you, running away?
Tell Me

(What) in the name of love
Are we doing?
In the name of love
(What) in the name of love
Are we losing?
What are we doing?

Take the risk and pay the price
