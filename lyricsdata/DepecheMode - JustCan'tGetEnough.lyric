When I'm with you baby
I go out of my head
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough

All the things you do to me
And everything you said
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

We slip and slide as we fall in love
And I just can't seem to get enough of

We walk together
We're walking down the street
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough

Every time I think of you
