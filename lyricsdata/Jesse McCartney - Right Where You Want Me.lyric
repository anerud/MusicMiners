Girl,
there's something bout me that you outta know.
I never felt the need to lose control.
Always held on back and played it slow.
But not this time.
Baby don't be gentle,
I can handle anything.

Baby,
take me on a journey.
I've been thinking lately,
I could use a little time alone with you.
Crazy,
let's do something, maybe.
Please don't take your time,
you got me,
right where you want me.
