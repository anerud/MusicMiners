Close the door
Let me give you what you've been waiting for
Baby, I got so much love to give
And I wanna give it all to you

Close the door
No need to worry no more
Let's bring this day to a pleasant end
Girl, it's me and you now

I've waited all day long
Just to hold you in my arms
And it's exactly like I thought it would be
Me loving you, and you loving me

Close the door
Let me rub your back where you say it's sore
...
