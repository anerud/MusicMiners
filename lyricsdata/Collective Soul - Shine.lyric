Give me a word
Give me a sign
Show me where to look
Tell me what will I find
What will I find?

Lay me on the ground
Fly me in the sky
Show me where to look
Tell me what will I find
What will I find?

Yea, yea, yea
Oh, Heaven let your light shine down
Oh, Heaven let your light shine down
Oh, Heaven let your light shine down
Oh, Heaven let your light shine down

Love is in the water
Love is in the air
