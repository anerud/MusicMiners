I tell you baby, this is no way to live
Make sacrifies, til there's nothing to give
Everyone says there's rules to obey
I can't follow when things never change
Holding my chequebook, got a leak in the pipe
Food on the table, but the landlord's knocked twice
I want more than the shit on my back
I've worked too hard just to repeat the past
