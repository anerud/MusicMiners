It's hard to remember how it felt before
Now I found the love of my life
Passes things, get more comfortable
Everything is going right

And after all the obstacles
It's good to see you now with someone else
And it's such a miracle that
You and me are still good friends
After all that we've been through

I know we're cool
I know we're cool
