Without you baby
I feel worthless
I'm livin on the edge

It's been an hour
since you've been gone
and that's too long
so come back home
I can't live without you
so I'll cry for you

do anything that I can
to feel that touch from your hand
sorry that I want you
lady what do I do

bridge:

you know you're everything I do
ooh yeah
do what you want me to
I would do anything
get on my knees for you
ooooh, baby
what else is there to do
...
